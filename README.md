# points
My first serious, non-trivial, non-tutorial suggested Python project was `points.py`. This repository features several evolutions of the project as I grew more experienced with Python - `IV` is still in development. The gist of the program is to take a set of coordinates, and fit a polynomial in `x` to them *exactly*. This is guaratneed to be possible if no coordinates share an x-coordinate. It is done by substituting each coordinate into the general equation for a polynomial of degree (`num of points - 1`), which results in a solvable system of simultaneous equations, which the program then solves with varying levels of elegance.
